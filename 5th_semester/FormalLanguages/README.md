MT.txt --- transition rules of Turing machine which checks whether input binary number is prime

Grammar.txt --- production rules of type 0 grammar which produces language of prime numbers

rules_for_1011.txt --- derivation of (binary) prime number 1011

converter.py --- produces type 0 production grammar rules by TM transition rules

interpreter.py --- produces derivation of given number using grammar production rules

Steps:

1) python converter.py
2) python interpreter.py input.txt grammar.txt rules_for_1011.txt
